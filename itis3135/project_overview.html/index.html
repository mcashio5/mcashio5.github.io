      <h3>1. Project Overview</h3>

      <h4>1.1 Application Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        Dragonfly Home Market is a small, read-only online catalog for surplus furniture owned
        by Dragonfly Homes, a residential staging company. The purpose of the application is to
        showcase gently used staging pieces that are ready to be sold, reduce surplus inventory,
        and make it easier for potential buyers to see what is available without needing to visit
        a warehouse or active staging job.
      </p>

      <h4>1.2 Intended Users of the Website</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Local homeowners and renters in the Charlotte area who want quality, gently used furniture at a discount.</li>

        <li>Current and past staging clients who want to purchase items that were used in their staged homes.</li>
        <li>Staff at Dragonfly Homes who will share links to specific pieces or collections with potential buyers.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- 5. Dynamic Functionality -->
    <section id="dynamic-functionality">
      <h3>5. Dynamic Functionality on the Website</h3>

      <h4>Filtering and Searching Inventory (Shop Inventory page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript will filter visible item cards based on category, room, and price range, updating the list immediately when the user changes a filter.</li>
        <li>A jQuery UI slider will be used for selecting the price range.</li>
        <li>Similar interactivity can be seen on large furniture sites like IKEA or Wayfair, where users narrow down products without leaving the page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>AJAX Loading of Furniture Data (Shop Inventory page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The furniture items will be stored in a JSON file.</li>
        <li>When the Shop page loads, JavaScript will send an AJAX request to retrieve the JSON data and then dynamically create the item cards.</li>
        <li>This allows the catalog to be updated by editing the JSON file instead of rewriting HTML.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interactive Image Gallery / Lightbox (Styled Rooms Gallery page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicking a gallery thumbnail will open the larger image in a modal overlay using jQuery or a lightbox plugin.</li>
        <li>Users can move between images using previous and next controls within the modal.</li>
        <li>Similar galleries exist on many portfolio and photography websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Wishlist Within the Session (Shop Inventory page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>When users click “Interested” on an item, JavaScript will add that item to a temporary wishlist displayed in a sidebar or panel.</li>
        <li>The wishlist will exist only in memory for the current browser session and will not be stored in a database, respecting the course rule against CRUD functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Form Validation and Confirmation (How to Buy / Contact page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript will validate required fields, check email format, and display inline error messages.</li>
        <li>On successful submission, the page will show a confirmation message (for example, “Thank you, we will contact you soon about your selected items.”).</li>
        <li>This behavior is similar to contact or inquiry forms on many small business websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Optional jQuery UI Accordion for FAQs (How to Buy / Policies page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The FAQ section may use a jQuery UI accordion widget so that each question expands and collapses when clicked.</li>
        <li>This keeps the page compact while still providing detail for users who want it.</li>
      </ul>
