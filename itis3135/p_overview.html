    <!-- 6. Dynamic Functionality -->
    <section id="dynamic-functionality">
      <h3>6. Dynamic Functionality on the Website</h3>

      <h4>Filtering and Searching Inventory (Shop Inventory page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript will filter visible item cards based on category, room, and price range, updating the list immediately when the user changes a filter.</li>
        <li>A jQuery UI slider will be used for selecting the price range.</li>
        <li>Similar interactivity can be seen on large furniture sites like IKEA or Wayfair, where users narrow down products without leaving the page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>AJAX Loading of Furniture Data (Shop Inventory page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The furniture items will be stored in a JSON file.</li>
        <li>When the Shop page loads, JavaScript will send an AJAX request to retrieve the JSON data and then dynamically create the item cards.</li>
        <li>This allows the catalog to be updated by editing the JSON file instead of rewriting HTML.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interactive Image Gallery / Lightbox (Styled Rooms Gallery page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicking a gallery thumbnail will open the larger image in a modal overlay using jQuery or a lightbox plugin.</li>
        <li>Users can move between images using previous and next controls within the modal.</li>
        <li>Similar galleries exist on many portfolio and photography websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Wishlist Within the Session (Shop Inventory page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>When users click “Interested” on an item, JavaScript will add that item to a temporary wishlist displayed in a sidebar or panel.</li>
        <li>The wishlist will exist only in memory for the current browser session and will not be stored in a database, respecting the course rule against CRUD functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Form Validation and Confirmation (How to Buy / Contact page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript will validate required fields, check email format, and display inline error messages.</li>
        <li>On successful submission, the page will show a confirmation message (for example, “Thank you, we will contact you soon about your selected items.”).</li>
        <li>This behavior is similar to contact or inquiry forms on many small business websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Optional jQuery UI Accordion for FAQs (How to Buy / Policies page)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inventory filtering on Shop page:</strong> JavaScript/jQuery to filter items by category, room, and price using dropdowns and a jQuery UI slider.</li>
        <li><strong>AJAX-loaded catalog:</strong> Load item data from a JSON file so inventory can be updated without editing HTML.</li>
        <li><strong>Image gallery lightbox:</strong> jQuery-based gallery on the Styled Rooms page, with modal view and next/previous controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Wishlist within session:</strong> Temporary “Interested” list stored in memory for the current visit only.</li>
        <li><strong>Form validation:</strong> JavaScript validation on the How to Buy / Contact form for required fields and email format.</li>
        <li><strong>jQuery UI accordion:</strong> Optional FAQ accordion on the Policies/Contact page.</li>
        <li>The FAQ section may use a jQuery UI accordion widget so that each question expands or collapses when clicked.</li>
        <li>This keeps the page compact while still providing detail for users who want it.</li>
